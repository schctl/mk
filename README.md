# mk (^âˆ‡^)-b


`mk` is a tool to run unix commands as another user, and a family of crates. It is similar to [`doas`](https://github.com/Duncaen/OpenDoas) or [`sudo`](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo).

---

### Requirements

 - Rust's nightly toolchain (1.56 or higher)

`x.py` is a helper script to help build, test and install `mk`. Use `./x.py -h` to see all options.

```sh
$ ./x.py --clean --build
```

**install `mk`**

```sh
$ ./x.py --install
