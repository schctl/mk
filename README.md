# mk (^âˆ‡^)-b

`mk` is a tool to run unix commands as another user, similar to OpenBSD's `doas`, for the desktop. Linux support is targeted first.

**Disclaimer:** I am not an expert, and this project is still very early in development. Don't use this anywhere except for testing.

### Building

Rust's' `nightly` toolchain is required. The only version that this has been tested with is `1.56.0-nightly`.

The `build.sh` script will build `mk` and create a copy in the project's root, with permissions setup for testing.

### License

`mk` and all its crates are distributed under the terms of the MIT license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more information.
